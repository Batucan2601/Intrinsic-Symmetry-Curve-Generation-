Data Sets:
SCAPE: 71 meshes representing a human body in different poses. All the meshes were fit to scanner data with a common template (thus corresponding vertices have same IDs).
TOSCA: 80 meshes representing people and animals in a variety of poses. The meshes appear in 8 groups with common topology (corresponding within the same class have the same ID).
Watertight: 400 meshes arranged evenly in 20 object categories, many of which are articulated figures (humans, octopus, four-legged animals, ants, etc.). We selected 11 classes for our experiments that have well defined correspondences and genus zero. In addition, we excluded two human models with non-zero genus.
